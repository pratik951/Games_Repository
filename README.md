3) BlackJack:      
    
     The game starts by dealing two cards to the player and two cards to the dealer. The player can see one of the dealer's cards and their own hand. The objective is to get a hand total as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. The player is given the option to "hit" (receive another card) or "stand" (stop receiving cards). If the player's hand exceeds 21, they lose. Once the player stands, the dealer reveals their second card and continues to draw cards until their hand value reaches 17 or more. After the dealer finishes drawing cards, the final hands are compared. If the player's hand value exceeds 21, they lose. If the dealer's hand exceeds 21, the  player wins. If neither hand exceeds 21, the hand with the highest value wins. If both hands have the same value, it results in a tie.The game prompts the player to play again or quit after each round.
